# Gradient-descent-in-Predicting-weights
Based on training data, through gradient descent learning, to find the optimal parameters for linear equations. 
The training process needs to select parameters that affect the results of the model such as learning rate, initial value of parameters and number of iterations to update the weights.
The project also expands the linear relationship by building linear functions with a nonlinear function (polynomial), which will help the model be more general.
